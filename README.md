ML model

The optimal parameters found for the RandomForestRegressor,
{'max_depth': 20, 'n_estimators': 100},
indicate that a balance between the model's complexity and the dataset's characteristics was achieved.
A deeper tree depth allows for capturing the non-linear relationships and complex patterns present in the housing data,
while a higher number of estimators helps in reducing the variance of the predictions,
leading to a more robust and generalizable model.
The fact that these parameters remained optimal even after applying PCA, 
despite a slight decrease in performance, 
suggests that the model's capacity to handle the dataset's complexity is crucial.
The decrease in performance with PCA highlights the trade-off between simplification through dimensionality reduction and the loss of potentially informative features that contribute to predicting housing prices accurately. 
Essentially, the parameters were optimal because they allowed the RandomForestRegressor to effectively learn from the dataset's inherent structure and complexity.


Why Would PCA Be Useful or Not?
Useful: If the original features are highly correlated and the dataset is high-dimensional, PCA can improve model performance by reducing the dimensionality, thus helping to mitigate issues like the curse of dimensionality and overfitting.
Not Useful: If most of the variance in the data is spread across many dimensions or if reducing dimensionality leads to the loss of important information, applying PCA might deteriorate the model's performance.
